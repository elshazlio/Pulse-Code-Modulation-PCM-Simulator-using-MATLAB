# Pulse-Code-Modulation-PCM-Simulator-using-MATLAB
MATLAB PCM System Simulator demonstrating digital signal processing fundamentals. Features sampling, quantization (uniform/μ-law), multiple encoding schemes, and signal reconstruction. Includes interactive parameter selection, visualization tools, and frequency analysis. Written for a communications course.

Our MATLAB-based Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) System Simulator provides a comprehensive implementation of digital signal processing fundamentals. The simulator demonstrates the complete PCM chain: sampling, quantization, encoding, decoding, and signal reconstruction. The system supports both uniform and nonuniform (μ-law) quantization, multiple encoding schemes (unipolar, polar, and Manchester), and includes advanced signal reconstruction with adaptive interpolation. While the default implementation uses a cosine test signal, the system is designed to process any arbitrary input signal within the specified amplitude range.
